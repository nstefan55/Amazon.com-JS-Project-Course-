1) Main Idea of JavaScript

1. SAVE THE DATA

    data = information

    (info about our products)

    saved data in an object or arrays to create data structures



2. GENERATE html

    use the saved data to GENERATE

    loop through the array of data


    products.rating.stars * 10

    We are multiplying it by 10 beacuse it displays rating-4.5.png which needs to be rating-45.png


    priceCents / 100 to display it in dollars


    "js show number with 2 decimal places"




3. make it interactive






2) HTML Data Attribute

- html attribute that starts with "data"

example data-product-name: "${product.name}"



.dataset - gives us all data attributes that are signed to the button






3) Steps to adding to cart 

1. check if the product is already in the cart

2. if it is in the cart then we increase the quanity by 1

3. if its not then add it to cart





4) Making the Cart icon interactive

1. calculate the quantity

    loop through the array
    and add the quantity

2. put the quantity on the page
